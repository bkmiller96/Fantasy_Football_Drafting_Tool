# Fantasy_Football_Drafting_Tool
In this, I created a tool using shiny to draft players for my season long fantasy football leagues. As a part of this, I first scrape and clean projections from 11 different sources and aggregate them together. I then use that data to populate the tool in a format where the rankings of players changes based on specific league settings and scoring rules.
